Please note: 

This is not yet a functional application. Additional configuration and development
will need to take place to allow for proper DB integration, as well as to form
linkages with Azure DevOps. At this time, none of these things are in place, and the
code shown here is largely theoretical.

Documentation on its various components is also forthcoming, once the application is
in a deployable and functional state.

For the time being: It builds! There may be logic errors remaining in the code at this phase.
